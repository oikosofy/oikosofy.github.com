        <h2>REN</h2>
        <p>Based on some initial conversations we believe that the following packages are of interest for REN.</p>

<h3>Community of Practice - Practical knowledge sharing</h3>
<p>Knowledge sharing is a common problem in many companies. Software development is complex and requires a lot of effort and time. Knowledge is valuable and must be shared between all the teams sharing a technology platform. Oikosofy can plan and implement a Community Of Practice (CoP) where knowledge sharing can become a natural process in your organization. Through this approach we can help you start and develop your Community of Practice, keeping the knowledge in house.</p>

<h3>Evaluate code quality risk and devise quality strategy</h3>
<p>Technical Debt is a major threat to a stable and continuous business. Technical Debt can slow down your development process and make changes to your applications slow and difficult. Oikosofy's experience in Agile software development is a key asset in detecting and tackling Technical Debt. We can provide a suitable and targeted packages that focuses on evaluating the risks in your code base and devise a quality strategy together with your technical teams. Ensuring that in the long term you will not be slowed down by the accumulated Technical Debt.</p>

<h3>Internal training program with experience sharing</h3>
<p>Keeping up with the latest developments in the software development field takes time and effort. Being up to date on the latest technology developments is key to being able to keep up the speed of innovation. Oikosofy is your partner in researching the latest innovations in software development, project management and knowledge work management. Together we can plan and implement an internal training program as a very cost-effective way to keep your teams up to date with the latest developments, and share the learnings collected from different teams. Knowledge is valuable, investing in creating and keeping knowledge in house always pays back.</p>

<h3>Lessons learned facilitation</h3>
<p>A best practice in all industries. Detailing, discussing and documenting lessons learned from previous projects help the organization keep the knowledge collected in diverse projects. Be it knowledge sharing, best practice collection or improvement suggestions, reflecting on how we work is a proven way to continuously improve your organization. Oikosofy is your counterpart in facilitating energizing and engaging lessons learned sessions. Learning is the enabler for change and improvement.</p>

<h3>Project management audting and improvement suggestions</h3>
<p>It is easy to get caught up in the repetition, every project being run with the same process, even when the context demands a different approach. Processes need to change to adapt to the new reality. Reviewing your operational processes and Project Management practices is a good method to come up with innovative and novel approaches. Oikosofy, with its long experience in software development and project management is your partner in the continuous process of reviewing and improving how you manage your projects. Projects are the vehicle to transform your ideas into innovations, we take good care of them.</p>

<h3>The Ghostbuster Package</h3>
<p>When you have a problem, who will you call? Oikosofy is there with you. Assessment, consulting and support when you most need it. Break the barrier, achieve a breakthrough. We can propose even more concrete packages, but we would need to investigate the situation with your cooperation. The Ghostbuster package is a time-limited and risk-limited approach to creating a wider picture of the challenges that need to be tackled and helps us customize our proposal even further. At the same time we deliver a complete report with concrete suggestions which you can apply immediately.</p>
