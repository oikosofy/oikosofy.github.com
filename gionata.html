        <h2>Gionata</h2>
        <p>Based on some initial conversations we believe that the following packages are of interest for Gionata.</p>

<h3>Adoption an Agile mindset throughout the whole organization</h3>
<p>Every organization that initiates any transformation will run into different hurdles and challenges. Oikosofy is an expert in Agile transformations and we can help you with the different challenges that lie ahead. Oikosofy knows how to achieve the benefits that an Agile mindset will enable. We will also help you identify the enablers (people) within your current organization to make the transformation go as smooth as possible. Oikosofy stands on the wisdom of many successful and failed Agile transformations and will use these lessons to help you.
<ul>
  <li> Coaching Agile development to development teams
  <li> Setting up different team setups
  <li> Introducing working within iterations 
  <li> Definition of Done
  <li> Coaching product managers
  <li> ...
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Change the role of Leadership</h3>
<p>Leadership has a very different role and responsibility within an Agile organization; an often misguide thought is that Agile adoption only affects the development organization. Oikosofy will help you development your whole organization towards an organization that values transparency over constant negotiation. The role of leadership in an Agile Organization is drastically different from the typical command and control approach seen in many traditional organizations. Managers in an Agile organization are facilitators, they make sure their teams have everything they need to get the job done. Oikosofy knows how to get the right mindset in-place to prepare your organization for the future.
<ul>
  <li> Coaching different levels of management
  <li> Introducing different ideas to help make the organization more transparent
  <li> Make sure the whole organization is aligned towards the same goals
  <li> Create a strong vision
  <li> Empower the different teams, leadership will be spread in the whole company
  <li> ...
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Agility at the Strategy and Portfolio level</h3>
<p>As the world changes, learning and adapting become key competitive advantages for product organizations. A key step in the learning process for every organization is how to transfer the knowledge collected over several months or even years that lead to designing the strategy that will lead the company to the next level.Agility requires a constant review and adjustment of our actions to achieve the expected goals. However the strategy to action cycles are hard enough to execute on a 12 month cycle, how to make it faster? Oikosofy's approach is different. Together with you we will create a strategy to action cycle that will help you regularly adjust the direction, managing the direction of the company on a much shorter cycle. From top-management to execution level and back in 2 months, regularly.
<ul>
<li>Designing the 'Strategy to action' cycle with review and adaptation
<li>Design and implement portfolio management process that links to the Strategy and execution cycle
<li>Train management team on agility for strategy and agile portfolio management
<li>Coach the first 'Strategy to action' cycles, practicing the process together
<li>Product management training, including portofolio management as well as how to benefit from agility at the development team level
<li>Training development teams to provide technical feedback at the portofolio level
<li>Strategy to Portfolio cycle every 6 months
<li>Portoflio re-evaluation every 2 months based on actual results (adapt based on progress)
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Iterim CTO and executive coaching</h3>
<p>Agile adoption is a hard process, there is no single way to go about it. Many companies fail in agile adoption for different reasons. Oikosofy is your partner in preparing, designing and executing the Agile adoption program. Agile adoption is not just another change program, we can provide support at all levels of the organization, from training to hands-on coaching. From executive coaching to helping you design the management framework to support Agile adoption. Each of these contributing to evolve your organization, helping it become more flexible and adaptable.
<ul>
<li>Designing and executing Agile adoption program
<li>Arranging experience sharing sessions about Agile adoption with several companies around the world
<li>Training and coaching on management paradigms and practices that enable successful agile transitions
<li>Hands-on coaching with all levels of the organization to keep the agile adoption process dynamic and coherent throughout the whole process
