        <p>Based on some initial conversations we believe that the following packages are of interest for Gionata.</p>

<h3>Designing and creating a high-performance organization</h3>
<p>Organizations need to evolve, as they try to evolve they run into different hurdles and challenges. Agile adoption is a promising strategy to evolve organizations and help them adapt quickly and effectively to real-world challenges. Oikosofy stands on the wisdom of many Agile transformations and will use these lessons to your benefit. Oikosofy is an expert in organizational transformation and Agile adoption.

  <li> Definition of Done
  <li> Coaching product managers
  <li> Hands-on coaching for software development teams
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Leadership for high-performance organizations</h3>
<p>Product development organizations have a significant challenge, adapt quickly or become obsolete. The rate of product innovation is increasing and it is necessary to run forward as fast as we can just to keep up with the competition. In this rapid evolution environment leadership has a very different role. An often misguide thought is that Agile adoption only affects the development organization. Oikosofy will help you develop your whole organization towards an organization that values transparency over constant conflict. Leaders and Managers in an Agile organization are facilitators that enable high-performance behavior at all levels of the organization. Oikosofy knows how to get the right mindset in-place to prepare your organization for the future.
<ul>
  <li> Coaching and support at different levels of the organization from technical to senior leadership
  <li> Enabling high-performance through effective communication and transparency
  <li> Facilitate and support Strategy and Operational Management to create an aligned organization
  <li> Techniques and strategies to develop high-performance organizations
  <li> Distributed cognition - the high performance key. How leadership enables effective organizations
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Agility at the Strategy and Portfolio level</h3>
<p>As the world changes, learning and adapting become key competitive advantages for product organizations. 
Transforming a winning stratey into action is a key learning process for an organization. Without an effective strategy learning process execution will fail. That cycle, of transforming strategy knowledge into action we call 'Strategy to Action Cycle'. As the execution starts we collect more information, how to adapt to that information? How to learn and adapt faster than the competitors? The strategy to action cycles are hard enough to execute on a 12 month cycle, how to make it faster? Oikosofy's approach is different. Together with you we will create a strategy to action cycle that will help you regularly adjust the direction, managing the direction of the company on a much shorter cycle. From top-management to execution level and back in 2 months, regularly.
<ul>
<li>Designing the 'Strategy to action' cycle with review and adaptation
<li>Design and implement portfolio management process that links to the Strategy and execution cycle
<li>Train management team on agility for strategy and agile portfolio management
<li>Coach the first 'Strategy to action' cycles, practicing the process together
<li>Product management training, including portofolio management as well as how to benefit from agility at the development team level
<li>Training development teams to provide technical feedback at the portofolio level
<li>Strategy to Portfolio cycle every 6 months
<li>Portoflio re-evaluation every 2 months based on actual results (adapt based on progress)
</ul>
</p>

<p>Agile adoption is a hard process, there is no single way to go about it. Many companies fail in agile adoption for different reasons. Oikosofy is your partner in preparing, designing and executing the Agile adoption program. Agile adoption is not just another change program, we can provide support at all levels of the organization, from training to hands-on coaching.
