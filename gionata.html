<h3>Agility at the Strategy and Portfolio level</h3>
<p>As the world changes, learning and adapting become key competitive advantages for product organizations. A key step in the learning process for every organization is how to transfer the knowledge collected over several months or even years that lead to designing the strategy that will lead the company to the next level.Agility requires a constant review and adjustment of our actions to achieve the expected goals. However the strategy to action cycles are hard enough to execute on a 12 month cycle, how to make it faster? Oikosofy's approach is different. Together with you we will create a strategy to action cycle that will help you regularly adjust the direction, managing the direction of the company on a much shorter cycle. From top-management to execution level and back in 2 months, regularly.
<ul>
<li>Designing the 'Strategy to action' cycle with review and adaptation
<li>Design and implement portfolio management process that links to the Strategy and execution cycle
<li>Train management team on agility for strategy and agile portfolio management
<li>Coach the first 'Strategy to action' cycles, practicing the process together
<li>Product management training, including portofolio management as well as how to benefit from agility at the development team level
<li>Training development teams to provide technical feedback at the portofolio level
<li>Strategy to Portfolio cycle every 6 months
<li>Portoflio re-evaluation every 2 months based on actual results (adapt based on progress)
</ul>
